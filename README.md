# DeptCase
This small one page website is made to show off my gained knowledge so far with React. This is by no means perfect and there is a lot to improve on!

## How to run this project
After cloning the repo you can run **npm install**. This will install all the necessary packages for you.
When the install is complete run **npm start**. This will start the local server where you can see the one pager in action.


## Future work
- Better grid setup
- Better responsiveness.
- Use local data to loop through the grid and show the different clientcards.
- Implement a filter system.
